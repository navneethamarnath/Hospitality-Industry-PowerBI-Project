## Insights & Recommendations
With this limited availability of data, we could only analyze booking facts. To better assess the overall health of the business, additional data is needed. Below are key insights and recommendations:

1. **Low Average Rating (3.68)**: This is concerning for a business that operates in the luxury and business hotel segment. Focus should be placed on improving guest experience.
2. **Guest Feedback**: More emphasis on collecting ratings and reviews to understand guest concerns better.
3. **Operational Costs**: Need more data on running and operating costs to analyze spending efficiency.
4. **Occupancy Rate (58%)**: Determine whether this is a seasonal trend or if competitors are performing better.
5. **Weekend Occupancy**: Even during peak times, occupancy is below **75%**. Aim for **90%** to maximize revenue.
6. **Weekday Occupancy**: Currently just over **50%**, which is a concern. Measures should be taken to increase weekday bookings.
7. **Market Expansion**: Consider expanding into other major metropolitan cities in India to increase revenue and market share.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with real-time data sources** for live analytics.
- **Advanced predictive analytics** using machine learning models.
- **Additional dashboard pages** for deeper insights into marketing and loyalty programs.
